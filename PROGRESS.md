## Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Project Setup
1. Create a new Supabase project at https://supabase.com
2. Go to Settings > API to get your project URL and anon key
3. Copy `env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Supabase credentials
4. Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local` with your actual Supabase project URL and anon key

### 2. Database Setup
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard > SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
3. Run the SQL to create all tables and policies

### 3. Google OAuth Setup
1. Go to Authentication > Providers in your Supabase dashboard
2. Enable Google provider by clicking the toggle switch
3. You'll need to create a Google OAuth application:
   - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
   - Create a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   - **Choose "External" audience** (allows users outside your organization)
   - Set the authorized redirect URI to: `https://pqxboqvdsztbpofyasxj.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
   - Copy the Client ID and Client Secret
4. Add your Google OAuth credentials (Client ID and Secret) to the Supabase Google provider settings
5. Save the configuration

**Note**: If you see "Unsupported provider: provider is not enabled" error, it means Google OAuth is not enabled in your Supabase project.

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Current Status
âœ… **Phase 2 Complete**: Authentication and database setup is fully implemented and ready for use.
ðŸ”§ **Environment Variables Fixed**: Created `env.example` file with required Supabase configuration.
âœ… **Google OAuth Working**: Sign-in functionality is now fully operational.

**Next Priority**: Implement individual tree view and member management features.

## Recent Fixes
- **Environment Variables**: Created `env.example` file with required Supabase environment variables
- **Setup Instructions**: Updated setup instructions to include environment variable configuration
- **Environment Variable Handling**: Improved error handling in Supabase client with better debugging information
- **Development Server**: Cleared Next.js cache to ensure environment variables are properly loaded
- **Environment File Format**: Recreated `.env.local` with proper UTF8 encoding to fix environment variable loading issues
- **Google OAuth Setup**: Updated setup instructions with detailed Google OAuth configuration steps
- **Google OAuth Working**: Successfully configured Google OAuth provider and sign-in functionality
