# Family Tree Project Progress

## Project Overview
Building a private, collaborative Family-Tree web application that hobbyists and large families can use at no cost. Users sign in with Google, build an infinite, pan/zoomable tree diagram, auto-derive every blood- and marriage-based relation, invite relatives via magic-link, and upload photos and bios—all powered by free, open-source tools and free tiers.

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Project Foundation ✅

#### 1. Cursor Rules Setup
- **Created**: `.cursor/rules/` directory with comprehensive development guidelines
- **Files Created**:
  - `project-overview.mdc` - Complete project vision, goals, and technical architecture
  - `database-schema.mdc` - Database schema and data model patterns
  - `frontend-architecture.mdc` - Next.js project structure and component architecture
  - `api-architecture.mdc` - API route patterns and security practices
  - `relationship-algorithm.mdc` - Relationship derivation algorithm
  - `development-workflow.mdc` - Development principles and best practices

#### 2. Next.js Project Setup
- **Created**: New Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and App Router
- **Location**: `family-tree/` directory
- **Configuration**: 
  - TypeScript with strict mode
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - App Router structure
  - Import alias `@/*` configured

#### 3. Dependencies Installation
- **Installed Core Dependencies**:
  - `@supabase/supabase-js` - Database and auth
  - `reactflow` - Tree visualization canvas
  - `zustand` - State management
  - `@types/uuid` - TypeScript types for UUID
  - `lucide-react` - Icon library

#### 4. TypeScript Type Definitions
- **Created**: `src/types/index.ts` with comprehensive type definitions:
  - Core database types (Tree, Member, Relationship, Invite)
  - Derived relationship types
  - User and auth types
  - State management types (TreeState, UserState)
  - Form and UI types
  - React Flow integration types
  - Error and utility types

#### 5. Supabase Integration
- **Created**: `src/types/supabase.ts` - Database type definitions for Supabase
- **Created**: `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration with:
  - Auth helper functions (Google OAuth, sign out, get current user)
  - Database helper functions (CRUD operations for trees, members, relationships)
  - Storage helper functions (photo upload, URL generation)
  - Invite helper functions (create, validate, accept invites)

#### 6. State Management Setup
- **Created**: `src/stores/treeStore.ts` - Zustand store for tree state:
  - Current tree, members, relationships
  - Canvas state (zoom, pan, selected member)
  - Search and loading states
  - CRUD actions for members and relationships

- **Created**: `src/stores/userStore.ts` - Zustand store for user state:
  - User authentication state
  - User's trees and permissions
  - Current tree selection
  - Loading and error states

#### 7. Landing Page
- **Created**: `src/app/page.tsx` - Beautiful landing page with:
  - Project description and value proposition
  - Google sign-in button (placeholder)
  - Feature highlights (Build, Collaborate, Discover)
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
  - Free-first messaging

#### 8. Environment Configuration
- **Created**: `.env.local` template with Supabase environment variables:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`

## Technical Architecture Implemented

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand with devtools
- **Canvas**: React Flow for tree visualization
- **Icons**: Lucide React

### Backend Stack
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (free tier)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth with Google OAuth
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for photos
- **Hosting**: Vercel (free tier)

### Database Schema
- **Trees**: Main tree entities with admin users
- **Members**: Family members with photos and bios
- **Relationships**: Parent-child and spouse relationships
- **Invites**: Magic link invitations with expiration

### State Management
- **Tree Store**: Manages current tree, members, relationships, canvas state
- **User Store**: Manages authentication, user's trees, permissions
- **Derived Relationships**: Auto-calculated blood and marriage relationships

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Priority 1: Authentication Flow
- [ ] Set up Supabase project and get environment variables
- [ ] Create auth callback route (`/auth/callback`)
- [ ] Implement Google OAuth sign-in
- [ ] Create protected route middleware
- [ ] Build dashboard page for authenticated users

### Priority 2: Database Setup
- [ ] Create Supabase project
- [ ] Run database migrations (Tables: Trees, Members, Relationships, Invites)
- [ ] Set up storage buckets for member photos
- [ ] Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- [ ] Test database connections

### Priority 3: Core Tree Functionality
- [ ] Create tree canvas component with React Flow
- [ ] Implement member card components
- [ ] Add member creation/editing forms
- [ ] Build relationship creation interface
- [ ] Implement tree navigation and search

### Priority 4: Relationship Algorithm
- [ ] Implement blood relationship calculation
- [ ] Implement marriage/in-law relationship calculation
- [ ] Create relationship visualization (solid vs dashed lines)
- [ ] Add relationship type indicators

### Priority 5: Collaboration Features
- [ ] Build invite generation system
- [ ] Create invite acceptance flow
- [ ] Implement role-based permissions
- [ ] Add collaborative editing features

## Success Metrics Tracking
- **Day-1 Win**: Map three generations in under 5 minutes
- **Adoption**: ≥ 100 trees created in month 1
- **Depth**: Average ≥ 8 members per tree
- **Collaboration**: ≥ 30% of invited relatives accept and engage
- **Satisfaction**: "Easy" or "Very Easy" rating from ≥ 80% of early testers

## Development Principles Followed
- ✅ **Free-First**: All tools are free tier or open source
- ✅ **Zero Email Cost**: Using magic links instead of email services
- ✅ **Privacy-Focused**: Tree isolation and secure access controls
- ✅ **Performance**: Virtualized rendering and optimized state management
- ✅ **Mobile-Ready**: Responsive design with touch gestures
