# Family Tree Application Overview

## Project Vision
A private, collaborative Family-Tree web application that hobbyists and large families can use at no cost. Users sign in with Google, build an infinite, pan/zoomable tree diagram, auto-derive every blood- and marriage-based relation, invite relatives via magic-link, and upload photos and bios—all powered by free, open-source tools and free tiers.

## Success Metrics
- **Day-1 Win**: Map three generations in under 5 minutes
- **Adoption**: ≥ 100 trees created in month 1
- **Depth**: Average ≥ 8 members per tree
- **Collaboration**: ≥ 30% of invited relatives accept and engage
- **Satisfaction**: "Easy" or "Very Easy" rating from ≥ 80% of early testers

## Technical Architecture (Free-First)
```
[Browser: React + React Flow/D3.js]
